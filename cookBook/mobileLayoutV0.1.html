        <h3>Steps / Description</h3>
        <p>Line a 10 x 5-inch loaf pan with plastic wrap, leaving overhang on the two long sides.</p>
        <p>Melt the sorbet in a small saucepan. Line the bottom of the prepared pan with the ladyfingers, then drizzle the sorbet over the top. Set aside until the cookies absorb the liquid, 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, bring the ice cream to room temperature for 10 minutes or until soft enough to easily remove from containers. Without mixing, scoop the ice cream on top of the cookies, using a spatula to press into an even layer. Freeze for at least 2 hours or up to 24 hours (covering lightly with plastic wrap after 1 hour).</p>
        <p>Bring 1 inch water to a boil in a medium saucepan, then reduce to a simmer. Place the egg whites and sugar in the large bowl of an electric mixer and set over the saucepan (without touching the water). Turn the heat off and whisk the mixture constantly until the sugar dissolves, 3 to 5 minutes (test by rubbing a little of the mixture between two fingers—you should not feel any grains).</p>
        <p>Transfer the bowl to the electric mixer and, with the whisk attachment, whisk the mixture on high speed until stiff glossy peaks form, about 7 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a large piping bag fitted with a large star tip.</p>
        <p>Using the overhangs, remove the ice cream from the pan and transfer to a serving platter, carefully removing the plastic so the cookies are on the bottom. Pipe rosettes all over the ice cream; return to the freezer to firm up, at least 30 minutes or up to 1 day.</p>
        <p>When ready to serve, toast the meringue lightly with a blowtorch.</p>

        <h3>Steps / Description</h3>
        <p>Heat oven to 350ºF. Line 12 regular-size (2 1⁄2-in. diam) muffin cups with paper liners.</p>
        <p>Beat butter, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl with mixer on low speed 1 minute or until well blended. Add eggs; beat 2 minutes or until fluffy. Beat in milk and vanilla (batter may look curdled), then flour just until blended.</p>
        <p>Spoon scant 1⁄4 cup batter into each muffin cup, filling each about 2⁄3 full.</p>
        <p>Bake 20 to 25 minutes until a wooden pick inserted in centers of cupcakes comes out clean. Cool in pan on a wire rack 5 minutes before removing from pan to rack.</p>
        <p>Repeat steps 3 and 4 with remaining batter. Let cupcakes cool completely before frosting and decorating.Each recipe makes 24 cupcakes. If you have two 12-cup muffin pans, you can bake them side by side on the middle rack of your oven if space permits.</p>
        <p>Unfrosted cupcakes can be stored covered at room temperature up to a day, or frozen in an airtight container up to a month. Thaw before frosting. Once frosted and chilled, they can be refrigerated, very loosely covered, up to 2 days.</p>
        <p>For the ganache: Gently heat 3/4 cup heavy cream over medium heat, then pour over 8 ounces finely chopped bittersweet chocolate. Let sit for 1 minute; stir until melted and smooth. Evenly spoon ganache on top of 12 large or 24 small chocolate cupcakes. Let set for 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>For the lettering: Microwave 3 ounces white chocolate on 50% power in 20-second intervals until melted and smooth. Transfer to a piping bag fitted with a 1.5 tip, then get creative!</p>

        <h3>Steps / Description</h3>
        <p>Preheat oven to 325º and butter an 8" or 9" springform pan.</p>
        <p>Make crust: In a food processor, blend Oreos with melted butter and salt. Pat into a springform pan and set aside while you make filling.</p>
        <p>Make cheesecake: In a large bowl using a hand mixer, beat cream cheese and sugar until completely smooth and fluffy. Add cornstarch, then add eggs. Add Baileys and vanilla.</p>
        <p>Pour batter into crust and place on a large baking sheet.</p>
        <p>Bake until center of cheesecake is only slightly jiggly, 1 hour 20 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes. Let cheesecake cool in oven, 1 hour, then refrigerate until completely cool, 4 hours or up to overnight. (If you'd like to use a water bath, tightly wrap outside of springform pan with two layers of aluminum foil. Transfer to a deep roasting pan and pour in enough boiling water to reach halfway up the cheesecake pan. Bake as directed.)</p>
        <p>When ready to serve, make ganache: In a small saucepan over low heat, heat heavy cream. Place chocolate in a heat-proof bowl and pour over hot heavy cream. Let sit 3 minutes, then stir until creamy and no lumps remain. Refrigerate ganache until slightly thick, 15 minutes, and spread all over cheesecake. Let set 10 minutes, then serve.</p>

      <div class="description">
        <h3>Steps / Description</h3>
        <p>To make the crepes, add butter to a small saucepan and heat over medium heat. Whisk constantly until brown bits appear on the bottom, about 5-6 minutes, then immediately remove from heat and set aside. Combine all the remaining crepe ingredients in a blender or food processor. Add the browned butter and pulse for 30 seconds or until well combined, scraping down the sides as needed. Place the crepe batter in the refrigerator for about 20 minutes. This allows the bubbles to subside so the crepes will be less likely to tear during cooking. The batter will keep for up to 48 hours.</p>
        <p>Heat a non-stick pan or cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add butter or cooking spray (I like to use cooking spray) to coat. Pour 1/4 cup of crepe batter into the center of the pan and swirl to spread evenly. Cook for 30 seconds and flip. Cook another 10 seconds and then remove the crepe to a plate, spread a little butter on to the crepe while it's still warm. Continue to make the crepes until all the batter is gone, spreading each crepe with butter as it comes off the stove. Makes about 24 crepes. Allow the crepes to cool completely before assembling the cake.</p>
        <p>Working with one crepe at a time, spread a layer of Nutella over the crepe. Place the crepe onto your cake plate. Repeat with the remaining crepes until all the crepes have been used. I like to spread the crepe with Nutella BEFORE adding it to the cake stack. I find it is much easier to keep the cake straight this way. Once all the layers are assembled, cover the cake and place in the fridge for at least 2 hours, but preferably overnight.</p>
        <p>Once the cake is well chilled, add the heavy cream to a mixing bowl. Using an electric mixer, whip until stiff peaks form. Stir in the vanilla. Spread the whipped cream over top of the cake. Place the cake back in the fridge for 15 minutes or until ready to serve. Just before serving, top with the chocolate date cake (recipe below), drizzle with caramel (recipe below) and then sprinkle with pumpkin seeds.</p>
        <p>Bourbon Caramel: In a dry, large deep heavy skillet cook the sugar over moderately high heat, stirring constantly with a heat proof rubber spatula until the sugar is melted and turns a deep golden caramel, remove the skillet from the heat and add the chunks of butter one by one, whisk until combined. The caramel will bubble, this is ok. Now slowly add the cream and then whisk until combined. Return the pot to the heat and, cook the mixture over moderate heat, stirring until the   caramel has thickened, about 3-5 minutes. Remove from the heat, if using, add the bourbon + a pinch of salt. Set the caramel aside to cool before drizzling over the cake.</p>
        <p>Chocolate Date Cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease 6 (8 ounce or larger) ramekins and place on a baking sheet.</p>
        <p>Place the milk and dates in a small sauce pan set on low heat. Warm the mixture until the milk is steaming. Remove from the heat and stir in the chocolate until melted. Set aside to cool.</p>
        <p>In a mixing bowl, cream together the butter and brown sugar until fluffy. Add the vanilla and eggs. Beat until combined. Slowly add the flour, baking soda, baking powder and the chocolate mixture alternating between the two until both are gone. Mix until just combined.</p>
        <p>Divide the batter evenly among the prepared ramekins. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until just set in the center. Remove from the oven and let cool 5 minutes. Then carefully invert the cake onto a plate. Let cool slightly before adding to the crepe cake.</p>
