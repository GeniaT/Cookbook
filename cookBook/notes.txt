General:
  Focus first on english version, the french will be next
  For french version, check the tbs and ts in ml (might be different)

to foresee:
  Convert terms from recipe into terms for the shopping list: tablespoon = 20ml for ex. DONE
  At this point, we need to have the object with the recipes written in "20ml" format instead of "tablespoon" DONE
  then adapt the total function to separate the numbers (20) from the unit (ml) and sum only if both units for an ingredient from 2 recs are same
  if not the same, define a common unit for both (ml or l or ...)
  Focus on one Website and scrap it with python to grab the recipes from it and add them to my page (with its source its ok)

To do next:
  Deal with additions like "1cup" + "2cups" or "5ml + 15mls" or "1 oignon + 3 oignons"

To solve:
