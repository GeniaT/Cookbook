General:
  Focus first on english version, the french will be next
  For french version, check the tbs and ts in ml (might be different)

to foresee:
  JS:
    Sum only if both units for an ingredient from 2 recs are same
    if not the same, define a common unit for both (ml or l or ...)
    Think about a function and Data Structure to distinguish singular and plurals. see to implement maybe pluralize.js/adapt it to avoid
    3 tomato & 8 tomatoes in the shopping list.
    In the same page, to allow selecions from multiple packs of recipes, create a bigger html page and play with display:none
  Edge Cases:
    When clicking on "create/update", check if there are recipes selected. If not, msg the user
To do next:
  V0.2:
    Mobile first: common html for expanded and collapsed recipe. DONE
    Some Divs are hidden in the collapsed recipes (Use as much as possible flexbox) DONE
    Don't go into the detailed css of the inner divs. DONE
    DEV and UT of shopping list alimentation
    link the array of selected recipes to the conversion program
    Go more in some details of js (check for bugs)
    Start the tablet/desktop version by only working with additional css (html, js remains the same)
    start tablet then desktop with the same html and same main div css.
    Once the 3 formats are ok, add the detailed css and inner boxes.
