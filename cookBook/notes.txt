General:
  Focus first on english version, the french will be next
  For french version, check the tbs and ts in ml (might be different)

to foresee:
  JS:
    Sum only if both units for an ingredient from 2 recs are same
    if not the same, define a common unit for both (ml or l or ...)
    Think about a function and Data Structure to distinguish singular and plurals. see to implement maybe pluralize.js/adapt it to avoid
    3 tomato & 8 tomatoes in the shopping list.
    In the same page, to allow selecions from multiple packs of recipes, create a bigger html page and play with display:none

To do next:
  V0.2:
    Mobile first: common html for expanded and collapsed recipe. DONE
    Some Divs are hidden in the collapsed recipes (Use as much as possible flexbox) DONE
    Don't go into the detailed css of the inner divs. DONE
    DEV and UT of shopping list alimentation DONE
      Update selected/unselected recipes from shopping list div DONE
      Create an object as the output from recipe.js and manipulate the shopping list DOM
    link the array of selected recipes to the conversion program DONE

    Go more in some details of js (check for bugs)
      solve order of recipes when one is expanded. (by format)
      Add functionality for sending via mail the shop list
      add a reset function when create/update is clicked
      Add scroll bar if the number of ingredients from shop list exceeds the page height
      adding some padding here and there.
      Add an ancrage for the expanded recipe so the user sees it (if no other solution, ask of SO first)

    Start the tablet/desktop version by only working with additional css (html, js remains the same) DONE

    Add a js rule to expand only only recipe at a time: if a second is expanded, the last one is collapsed
      + update the classes and css of collapsed/selected items
    Once the 3 formats are ok, add the detailed css and inner boxes.

To solve:
  Selection of rec 2/3/5 = wrong peper quantities : 11,000000001ml (add math floor, round?)
