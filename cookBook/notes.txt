JS:
    Sum only if both units for an ingredient from 2 recs are same
    if not the same, define a common unit for both (ml or l or ...)
    Think about a function and Data Structure to distinguish singular and plurals. see to implement maybe pluralize.js/adapt it to avoid
    3 tomato & 8 tomatoes in the shopping list.
    In the same page, to allow selecions from multiple packs of recipes, create a bigger html page and play with display:none

DONE:
  Mobile first: common html for expanded and collapsed recipe. DONE
  Some Divs are hidden in the collapsed recipes (Use as much as possible flexbox) DONE
  Don't go into the detailed css of the inner divs. DONE
  DEV and UT of shopping list alimentation DONE
  Update selected/unselected recipes from shopping list div DONE
  Create an object as the output from recipe.js and manipulate the shopping list DOM
  link the array of selected recipes to the conversion program DONE
  Add a js rule to expand only only recipe at a time: if a second is expanded, the last one is collapsed DONE
    + update the classes and css of collapsed/selected items DONE
  Start the tablet/desktop version by only working with additional css (html, js remains the same) DONE
  solve order of recipes when one is expanded. (by format) DONE
  To solve:
    Selection of rec 2/3/5 = wrong peper quantities : 11,000000001ml (add math floor, round?) DONE
    add a reset function when create/update is clicked DONE
  See how to declare a click event on a non existent yet div (delete_icon) DONE
  add js function for removing a recipe from the shop list DONE


Go more in some details of js (check for bugs)
      Add scroll bar if the number of ingredients from shop list exceeds the page height
      test and refactor the code
      Add something for the user to go to the bottom on mobile via a link of button on each recipe.
        Maybe trigger the calculus + move the user to the shopping list display is same time (1click instead of 1)
